# Optimal Decision Tree Inference

This project implements an **optimal decision tree learning algorithm** based on **SAT solving**, following the methodology of the paper:

> "Efficient Inference of Optimal Decision Trees" by Florent Avellaneda, AAAI 2020

## Features
- Supports both **depth-minimizing** and **node-minimizing** decision trees
- Implements the full **incremental learning algorithm** using SAT constraints
- Converts tabular CSV datasets into **binary features**
- Includes **cross-validation**, **tree evaluation**, and **graph visualization**

## RUN
In Terminal, run the command python demo.py
